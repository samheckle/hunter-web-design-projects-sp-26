## Overview

This project-based class is designed to give students the experience of solving practical problems in web production and to add to the advanced student's web design portfolio with a comprehensive project. Students will work independently and in teams on a large-scale collaborative project. Students will learn the entire process of web interface design from project idea to completion. They will learn to collaborate in design teams, present work-in-progress, perform user testing, and meet deadlines. Projects are designed for non-commercial, in-house (CUNY) or other non-for-profit organizations. Using the cycle of design, implementation, and user testing and revision, students will learn how to design a successful website.

### [Statement on Technology](https://community.itp.io/community_statement#technology)

> We pledge to center creative and ethical uses of technology in our research, teaching, and making. We accept the claim that technology is a reflection of society, its histories, and its politics. We reject the claim that technology is neutral and acknowledge that every technology has the potential to do as much harm as good. We acknowledge that when technologies cause harm, the harm disproportionately affects Black, Brown, Indigenous, People of Color (BIPOC), queer, trans, disabled, femme, low-income, survivors, and all other marginalized bodies and communities worldwide.
>
> With this understanding, it is our responsibility to center these groups when hosting, participating in, or developing events (e.g. workshops or meetings), materials (e.g. courses, syllabi, resources), technologies (software, hardware, tools, etc) and creative applications made within this classroom (e.g. works of art, products, installations, experiments, etc).

## Course Requirements

| Grading                      |     |
| ---------------------------- | --- |
| Attendance and Participation | 20% |
| Readings                     | 20% |
| Group Evals                  | 20% |
| Projects                     | 40% |

### Rubrics

Every assignment will have an associated rubric for grading. You can view this rubric in Brightspace by clicking on the assignment discussion post and "View Rubric".

### Responsibility

Students are responsible for all assignments, even if they are absent. Late discussion posts, failure to complete assignments, and lack of preparedness will jeopardize your successful completion of this course. Please regularly check your email for class announcements, GitHub for class materials and notes, and Brightspace for assignment due dates and submissions.

#### Attendance and Participation

Students are required to follow along with in-class demos and submit their work at the end of class for participation credit. These will count as your participation for the day. **If you do not have your camera on, or you are not present in class to follow along with the in-class demos, you will not receive full participation**.

**There are no excused and unexcused absences**. You are able to miss 3 classes before it starts impacting your grade. Two late attendances (meaning more than 5 minutes late) will result in an absence. If you miss a class, you are welcome to book office hours to make up for your missed participation for the day.

### Late Assignments

Any work is considered late if it is submitted after the due date posted on Brightspace. For every day the work is late, the student will receive a 10 % penalty. You are not allowed to resubmit late work for an updated grade.

### Extension Policy

Extensions are admitted on an as-needed basis, as long as _the student informs the instructor more that 24-hours before the assignment is due_. **_There are absolutely no extensions on the midterm or the final_**.

### Use of Generative Artificial Intelligence (AI) Tools:

For the first 7 weeks of this course I would highly encourage you to to _avoid_ using AI or any external tools (other than the p5 reference) in this class. We will cover effective use cases later in the semester, but you will find you can go much further executing your ideas when you have a solid understanding of the core coding techniques.

With this in mind:

- You MAY use AI in the initial stages of research, idea generation, and drafting.
- You MAY use AI for language translation.
- However, you MAY NOT not rely on AI output for significant portions of your final project form unless it is a necessary part of your project concept.
- If you use AI at any stage in the creation of your project (including initial stages, idea generation, drafting, language translation, and final form), you must properly cite and disclose this use. This should include details on the specific tool and version used, as well as the nature of your usage (for example, in programming code, images, and/or text/writing).
- Citation should reference both the platform and any creator (“style of”) names or references.
- Please follow [this citation guide](https://guides.library.harvard.edu/c.php?g=1330621&p=10046069)
- If you fail to disclose the use of AI, you will receive a 0 on the assignment.

## Required Materials

As the class is on zoom, it is suggested to have access to a second monitor to be able to follow along more easily with the class demos.

1. A text editor
   - I use [VSCodium](https://vscodium.com/), which is an open source lightweight fork of [VSCode](https://code.visualstudio.com/), but you are welcome to use whatever is most comfortable.
   - I would encourage disabling any autocomplete tools (the text editor autocomplete, linting, or AI tools) as they may be disruptive while following along with class demos.
   - Suggested extensions: [Prettier](https://prettier.io/), HTML CSS Intellisense, EJS Language Support
2. Sign up for a [Github account](https://github.com/)
   - Suggested sign up for [Github Student Developer Pack](https://education.github.com/pack)
3. Sign up for a DigitalOcean account
   - You can receive $200 free credits from the Github Student Developer Pack
   - If that doesn't work, or you already used it, you can use my [referral link](https://m.do.co/c/c57ec6b3cb5f).
   - If you do not use either, you should expect $4 / month of this class (~$24 total). This does not include any optional domain purchasing. If this is not feasible, please let me know.
4. Install an FTP service.
   - I use [Cyberduck](https://cyberduck.io/), but Filezilla is fine.
5. Command Line Tools
   - Windows: Install [GitBash](https://git-scm.com/downloads)
   - Mac: Terminal is pre-installed, but you need to enable [Xcode Command Line Tools](https://developer.apple.com/xcode/resources/) by opening Terminal and running `xcode-select --install`
   - Linux: See [git docs](https://git-scm.com/install/linux) based on your distribution.
6. Install [Node.js](https://nodejs.org/en/download)
